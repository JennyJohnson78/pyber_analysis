# Pyber Analysis
## Overview
Pyber, a Python based ride-sharing app, needs an exploratory analysis performed on their data by city type, the creation of a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, and a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

The three city types serviced by Pyber are urban, suburban, and rural cities. Urban cities are by far the type of cities with the most riders. For every rural rider there are 5 suburban riders and 13 urban riders. Urban cities have over 30 times more drivers than rural cities, and over 6 times as many suburban drivers. Urban cities make up the bunlk of the revenue for Pyber, bringing in 9 times for revenue than rural cities, and over half as much more revenue than suburban cities. Even though urban and suburban cities bring in more revenue than rural cities, the fare in rural cities is more by both average fare per ride	and average fare per driver.

For the month of January 2019, urban, suburban, and rural cities all see an overall increase in revenue, with a dip in February for suburban and rural cities and a slight increase for urban cities. All city types see a sharp increase in revenue towards the end of February and a decrease towards the beginning of March. Revenue for rural and suburban cities increase slightly and stay relatively steady for the month of March, with urban city revenue spiking and falling several times, ending up at only a slightly higher level than the beginning of the month. Urban and suburban cities see a slight drop in the beginning of April and urban cities see a slight increase. Both urban and rural cities see a downward trend in revenue towards the end of April, with suburban cities seeing the highest increase in revenue for this time period.

## Summary
Because rural cities see the least amount of business but the highest individual fees, it can be deduced that rural customers have less access to drivers, thus shoulder more of a financial burden. Because rural cities also account of the least amount of revenue at any given time, there are two options: 1. cease business in rural cities, or 2. find a way to increase the amount of rides in rural areas. If drivers are from urban or suburban cities and are having to drive out to rural communities to conduct business, one solution would be to increase awareness of Pyber through a marketing campaign in rural cities and to recruit more rural drivers from within those communities. That would drive costs down while increasing the revenue from rural comunities. Another observation is that all three city types have peak times, like the end of February, and slower times, when it comes to revenue. To further increase the amount of rides for PyBer during their slower times, PyBer could offer customers some kind of incentive to ride via a discount or a rewards membership program. This could also be used specifically for rural communities to get them to ride more with Pyber. A third proposal could be to partner with other businesses in rural cities to increase the number of riders and thus increasing the amount of revenue for rural communities. Many people escape to rural communities for vacations and getaways, and PyBer could partner with other businesses such as restaurants and hotels to offer vacation-goers an all inclusive package that includes a deal for riding with Pyber. All three of these proposals would increase the amount of riders from rural (and suburban) cities and address the disparities that exist.
